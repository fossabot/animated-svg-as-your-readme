This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web.

This SMIL 3.0 edition is a new version, it extends the functionalities contained in SMIL 2.1 [\[SMIL21\]](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-smil/smil-refs.html#ref-SMIL21), incorporating new features useful within the industry.

This SMIL3.0 W3C Recommendation supersedes the 13 December 2005 SMIL 21 Recommendation [\[SMIL21\]](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-smil/smil-refs.html#ref-SMIL21).

The SMIL 3.0 [test suite](http://www.w3.org/2007/SMIL30/testsuite/) along with an [implementation report](http://www.w3.org/2007/SMIL30/SMIL30-implementation-result.html) are publicly released and are intended solely to be used as proof of SMIL 3.0 implementability. It is only a snapshot of the actual implementation behaviors at one moment of time, as these implementations may not be immediately available to the public. The interoperability data is not intended to be used for assessing or grading the performance of any individual implementation.
